                  <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
                  Using my problem-solving skills, I was able to develop
                  full-stack web applications that processed, analyzed, and
                  displayed large amounts of data.
                  <h2>Creativity:</h2>
                  With the help of Lyft team I had to design and implement
                  software to create new rental fleet in an effort to promote
                  more sustainable, linked cities across the US.
                  <h2>Organization:</h2>
                  I had to make sure all my code are organized and commented so
                  that my partners can use. And that code are useable and more
                  readable by my fellow coders or whoever will reference my code
                  later on.

                  <h2>Learning:</h2>
                  I had to consistently develop new skills. At first I was only
                  good at Web Development but then I had to learn new skills in
                  application layers, presentation layers, databases and more.
                  <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
                  I had to use my problem solving skills a lot to use
                  perspective of JP Morgan Chase to learn from Stock data and
                  set up a system for analysis of the data for their traders.
                  <h2>Resilience:</h2>
                  I got stuck a lot of times but I always made sure to keep
                  going and keep pushing because I always looked the end goal
                  and how great it would feel to see the end product.

                  <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
                  I used my problem solving skills to examine data to find
                  crucial consumer insights and potential uses for the
                  information in problem-solving.
                  <h2>Communication:</h2>
                  I had to communicate with clients to understand user needs and
                  then propose those idea to developers to better the software.
                  <h2>Teamwork:</h2>
                  Team work was super important for this job, I had to report my
                  understanding of different parts of the software with
                  different team to better the software. Analyzes user needs and
                  software requirements to inform system design
                  <h2>Learning:</h2>
                  Learning was a major part of this job, I had to continuous
                  study and learn new technologies. I had to communicate with
                  different level of leadership to understand and learn more to
                  better the technology.

                  <h2>Communication:</h2>
                  I ran and operated this business, so I had to deal with many
                  different types of customers from many different type of
                  backgrounds. It was difficult because I had to learn how
                  different customer might react and how to read them
                  beforehand. I also had to learn sale to a great extend.
                  <h2>Leadership:</h2>
                  This position required massive amount of leadership skills
                  that I gain by myself using trial and error, for instance
                  learning how to hire slowly and fire quickly, its a hard job
                  but after some time you get used to it.
                  <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
                  Since I was CIO or basically the guy who did all the tech work
                  in the company, I had to solve many problems myself, for
                  instance making an amazing website for the company, setting up
                  clover payment system so that the customer can pay with cards
                  and we can manage staff with it.
                  <h2>Learning:</h2>
                  I had to learn how to setup and use POS all by myself just
                  using some youtube videos, I had to learn how to use excel to
                  make key business decision for my business. All these took
                  massive amount of learning which took a lot of hard work and
                  of course patience.
